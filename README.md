# disk-copy-utility
This app is still a work in progress. It's purpose is to make a "smart" backup copy of files on a disk or in a folder, avoiding file types such as .exe, .dll, .cab, etc., and any file over a certain size (250 MB by default).
Build-depends on the following packages:
glade
python3-dev
libgirepository1.0-dev
